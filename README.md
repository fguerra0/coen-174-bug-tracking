# scu-bug-tracker
Improved bug tracker for SCU IT to use on their software


# TODO
* Dropdown menu to eliminate user error where possible for BugID, TesterID, etc. (with ID and NAME)
* Filter bugs shown to only show bugs assigned to specific dev/tester and in correct status/state
* When manager assigns bug, status changes to 'validating'
* Notes section for the tester & developer
* Name tables and styling (tim)
